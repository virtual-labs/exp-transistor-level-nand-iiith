**NAND AND NOR GATES: DEFINITIONS, SCHEMATICS, AND TRUTH TABLES**

**NAND Gate**

The NAND gate has one output and two or more inputs. The output is low only when all inputs are high; otherwise, it is high. A NAND gate can be viewed as an AND gate followed by an inverter.

Truth Table:
| Input A | Input B | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

**NOR Gate**

The NOR gate has one output and two or more inputs. The output is high only when all inputs are low; otherwise, it is low. A NOR gate can be viewed as an OR gate followed by an inverter.

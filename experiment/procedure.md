# NAND Circuit
## Components Required - 

* 2 PMOS
* 2 NMOS
* 1 VDD
* 1 GND

## Circuit Connections - 

* Drag the PMOS, NMOS, VDD and GND components to the workspace
* Connect the upper node of both the PMOS to VDD
* Middle nodes of PMOS 1 and NMOS 1 are connected to input 1 and middle nodes of PMOS 2 and NMOS 2 are connected to input 2 respectively
* Lower node of NMOS 2 is connected to GND and lower node of NMOS 1 is connected to the upper node of NMOS 2.
* Upper node of NMOS 1 is connected to the output 1
* Lower node of both the PMOS are connected to the output 

## Observations - 

* On clicking "validate" option after completing the circuit (assuming all connections are done correctly) you should see a table on the right side of the workspace
* By default, both the inputs have been set to 1 and the corresponding output observed is 0. To check otherwise, double-click the input.

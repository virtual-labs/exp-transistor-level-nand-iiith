      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The Karnaugh map shows that the output is 1 when B=1, regardless of the value of A. This simplifies to just B.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would mean the output depends only on A, but the K-map shows it depends on B.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A+B (A OR B) would be 1 when either A or B is 1, which doesn't match the given K-map pattern.",

        "c": "Correct. The Karnaugh map shows that the output is 1 when both A and C are 1, regardless of the value of B. This simplifies to AC.",
        "d": "Incorrect. ABC would only be 1 when all three variables A, B, and C are 1, which is more restrictive than what the K-map shows."

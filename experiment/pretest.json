      "question": "1. Which of the following gates gives 1 as the output only when its inputs are 0 only?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "NAND",
        "b": "XOR",
        "c": "XNOR",
        "d": "NOR"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The NAND gate does not give an output of 1 only when both inputs are 0; it gives 1 for other input combinations as well.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The XOR gate gives 1 when inputs are different, not only when both are 0.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The XNOR gate gives 1 when both inputs are the same, not only when both are 0.",
        "d": "Correct. The NOR gate gives 1 only when both inputs are 0; for all other cases, the output is 0."

        "a": "OR",
        "b": "XOR",
        "c": "NAND",
        "d": "AND"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The OR gate alone is not functionally complete because it cannot implement the NOT operation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The XOR gate alone is not functionally complete because it cannot implement the NOT operation.",
        "c": "Correct. The NAND gate is functionally complete and can be used to construct any other gate.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The AND gate alone is not functionally complete because it cannot implement NOT or OR operations."

        "a": "Incorrect. i and iii alone cannot realize all inverter functions.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In a CMOS NAND gate, the NMOS transistors are connected in series in the pull-down network.",
        "b": "Incorrect. In a CMOS NAND gate, the NMOS transistors are not connected in parallel; PMOS transistors are parallel in the pull-up network.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The connection of NMOS transistors is not random; it follows a specific design for logic functionality.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The NMOS connection is specifically series, not either parallel or series."

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While NAND is a universal gate, the question asks for all universal gates, not just NAND.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While NOR is a universal gate, the question asks for all universal gates, not just NOR.",
        "c": "Incorrect. OR gate is not a universal gate; it cannot implement all logical functions.",
        "d": "Correct. Both NAND and NOR gates are universal gates and can implement any logical function."

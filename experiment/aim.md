**DEFINITION OF NAND GATE8**

NAND gate has 1 output and 2 or more input
The output of the NAND gate is low only when all the inputs are high else it is low.
A NAND gate could be veiwed as an AND gate with inverter at the output

| Input A | Input B |Output |
|---------|---------|-------|
| 0       |  0      |	1   |
| 0       |  1      | 1     |

| 1       |	 1  | 0     |  

**DEFINITION OF NOR GATE**

NOR gate has 1 output and 2 or more input
The output of NOR gate is high only when all the inputs are low else it is high
A NOR gate could be viewed as an OR gate with inverter at the output

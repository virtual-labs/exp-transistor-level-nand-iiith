1. Draw truth table for NAND and NOR gate.  
2. Write the combinations of input for which NAND and NOR gate behaves exactly the same.  
3. How can a NAND gate can be inverted to behave as an inverter?  
4. What are the driving voltage range for n-switch and p-switch respectively?  
5. What is the advantage of making Karnaugh Map of any combinational logic?
